      <h2>What is AstroJS?</h2>
      <p>AstroJS is a modern frontend framework. It helps you build fast, lightweight, and efficient websites. Unlike other frameworks, Astro is designed for speed. It sends **zero JavaScript** to the browser by default, making your pages load instantly.</p>
      <p>With Astro, you can use your favorite tools like **React, Vue, Svelte, and Solid** without the usual performance problems. You write components, but Astro compiles everything into static HTML before it reaches the user. That means blazing-fast speeds, even on low-powered devices.</p>
      <p>Astro is not just another JavaScript framework. It’s a **game changer** in how websites are built and optimized. If you care about speed, efficiency, and clean development, Astro is for you.</p>

      <h2>Why is AstroJS So Good?</h2>
      <p>You want to build fast websites. Astro helps you do that better than anything else. Here’s why:</p>
      <p><strong>1. Zero JavaScript by Default</strong> – Most frameworks send too much JavaScript to the browser. Astro doesn’t. It only ships the **minimum** JavaScript needed, making your pages load instantly.</p>
      <p><strong>2. Works with Any Framework</strong> – You don’t have to pick sides. Use **React, Vue, Svelte, or Solid** in the same project. Mix and match them however you like.</p>
      <p><strong>3. Static Site Generation</strong> – Astro builds your site **before** users visit. That means no waiting, no lag, just pure speed.</p>
      <p><strong>4. Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Ready</strong> – Need dynamic content? No problem. Astro handles both **static** and **server-rendered** content with ease.</p>
      <p><strong>5. Built-In SEO Features</strong> – Search engines love fast sites. Astro makes sure your pages are **optimized**, load instantly, and rank higher in search results.</p>
      <p>You get a framework that’s fast, flexible, and future-proof. If you want to build the web the right way, Astro is your best choice.</p>
